# Random Quote Machine

This is a Random Quote Machine project created as part of my JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification from FreeCodeCamp. The project allows users to generate random quotes and share them on social media platforms.

## Project Overview

The Random Quote Machine fetches quotes from an external API and displays them on the screen. Users can click a button to generate a new quote, which is then updated in the interface. The project also includes social media icons to share quotes directly to Twitter, GitHub, and CodePen. The design features a modern, responsive layout with custom fonts and background images, providing an engaging user experience.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- Fetch API for handling asynchronous requests
